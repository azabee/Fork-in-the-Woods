Hello and welcome to the world of The Fork in the Woods! Users will navigate through a short “Choose Your Own Adventure” style thriller. The interface includes a Label to display the story, 
a Textbox, that users will need to enter a prompt into to progress through the story, a Clear button to clear any text that they have typed, and an Exit button to exit the program. Prompts 
will stand out from the rest of the paragraph as being both capitalised and in quotation marks like so: “Turn Left”. After you type in your preferred prompt, click the Enter button to progress 
through the story. Have fun and choose carefully! ;)
